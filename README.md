# React Hooks Global State Concept

This concept was based on this repository -> [https://github.com/diegohaz/constate](https://github.com/diegohaz/constate)

## Advantages:
- this pattern contains global state similar to Redux, it can be easily scalable
- no NPM dependency to handle data management (just two files that holds all the logic)
- clean and simple
- just functions (simple testing)


# To be considered:
- proper tests
- this breaks second rule of Hooks (**Donâ€™t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions**)  :confused:
